 # I can make a eprate module by writing a file (i.e. myMath.py) and import myMath


#strings 
# string.lower(), string.upper(), strings are arrys printing upto certin string a[n1:n2]


#lists (arrays)
list1 = [2,3,4,510,102]

#tuple is immutable 
# tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
# I can convert tuples into lists and vice a versa 

#Dictionaries - keys & values 
# age = { 'min':33, 'jang':12, 'han':23}
